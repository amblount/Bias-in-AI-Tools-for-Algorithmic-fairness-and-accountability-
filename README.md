# Bias in AI Tools for Algorithmic fairness and accountability
[Explanation of Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFADNppMYZQ)

## Abstract
Abstract:

In an effort to combat bias we need systems that provide transparency in algorithms. These systems would provide information on what an algorithm decided and why it made its decision. Including the obvious missteps of cultural biases to the biases that are more subtle. This workshop will go over the first steps you can take with new open source tools from IBM and Google called AI Fairness 360 and What-If respectively. We will also briefly point out steps and features that Microsoft and Amazon announced for their upcoming AI transparency tools.
